Application:

decode.py 
Execution: python3 decode.py
Note: Image to decode should called "testImage.png"

Using pill, I grab the width and height of the image. 
Going reverse to read the last 11 pixel's r,g,b values.
Using simple binary operator to grab the lsb of each color binary value
Combine the binary array and convert the string into an integer value

Using the integer value (aka length), I loop through the remaining pixels (12th pixel)
Once the length counter goes down to zero, I combine all the lsb values and
attempt to conver the binary to int, then from int to char.

encode.py
Execution: python3 encode.py
Note: code is incomplete, I was stuck on trying to convert the binary to int to char on
the decode.py file so I was not able to complete the encoding. Included are psudeo code.
