decode.py 
Execution: python3 decode.py
Instructions: make sure 'modifiedImage.png' is in the same folder

Using pill, I grab the width and height of the image. 
Going reverse to read the last 11 pixel's r,g,b values.
Using simple binary operator to grab the lsb of each color binary value
Combine the binary array and convert the string into an integer value

Using the integer value (aka length), I loop through the remaining pixels (12th pixel)
I combine all the lsb values into a string, and every 8th value i combine and convert
the binary into the char value.

For some odd reason I can only output part of the decoded message.

encode.py
Execution: python3 encode.py
Instructions: make sure your secret message is called 'secret.txt' 
and the image to encode is called 'Image.jpeg'

Using pill, I grab the width and height of the image.
I also open the text file and make sure that there is enough space for the text to be
encoded into the image. I then convert each character of the text into binary and store
it into an array.

Taking the length of the text * 8, I convert it to binary and use the last 11 pixel's
r,g,b lsb value to overwrite it. Starting from the 12th pixel, I begin encoding the pixel's
r,g,b lsb value with the value from the text array.
